# BankAccount

## Create a `BankAccount` class with the following:

* instance vars: `name`, `balance` (use `attr_reader` for these)
* methods: `deposit(amount)` and `withdraw(amount)` that affect the balance
* a `to_s` method that prints the name and the balance

* Test your code by creating two `BankAccount` objects, a "Checking" and a
  "Savings".

* Make some deposits and withdrawals and print the accounts using `puts`.
